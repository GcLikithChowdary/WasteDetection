Problem Statement
Waste management is a critical global issue, with improper disposal leading to environmental pollution, health hazards, and resource wastage. One of the key challenges is the lack of awareness and tools to help individuals and organizations properly classify and dispose of waste. Traditional methods rely on manual sorting, which is time-consuming, error-prone, and inefficient.

This project aims to address these challenges by leveraging Artificial Intelligence (AI) to automatically classify waste materials and provide disposal instructions.

Solution
The AI-Powered Waste Management System is a web-based application that uses AI models to:

Detect and Classify Waste: Identify waste materials from images and classify them into categories such as recyclable, non-recyclable, hazardous, compostable, and electronic.

Provide Disposal Instructions: Offer detailed instructions on how to dispose of each detected item.

Reward Users: Incentivize users with reward points for proper waste disposal.

The system is built using TensorFlow.js for object detection and classification.

Features
Image Upload: Users can upload images of waste materials.

Object Detection: Detects waste items in the image using the COCO-SSD model.

Waste Classification: Classifies detected items into categories (recyclable, non-recyclable, hazardous, compostable, electronic).

Disposal Instructions: Provides disposal instructions for each category.

Reward System: Awards points to users based on the category of waste.

Clear Functionality: Allows users to clear the results and start over.

How It Works
Image Upload: The user uploads an image of waste materials.

Object Detection: The COCO-SSD model detects objects in the image.

Classification: Detected objects are classified into waste categories using a custom classification logic.

Disposal Instructions: Disposal instructions are displayed based on the category.

Reward Points: Users earn reward points for proper waste disposal.

Clear Results: Users can clear the results and upload a new image.

AI Models Used
1. COCO-SSD (TensorFlow.js)
Purpose: Object detection.

Description: COCO-SSD is a pre-trained model that detects objects in images and returns bounding boxes, labels, and confidence scores. It is trained on the COCO (Common Objects in Context) dataset, which includes 80 object categories.

Use Case: Detects waste items in uploaded images.

2. MobileNet (TensorFlow.js)
Purpose: Image classification.

Description: MobileNet is a lightweight convolutional neural network (CNN) designed for mobile and edge devices. It is used for classifying images into predefined categories.

Use Case: Classifies detected objects into waste categories.

Future Upgrades
Expand Waste Categories:

Add more categories (e.g., medical waste, construction waste).

Improve classification accuracy with a custom-trained model.

Multi-Language Support:

Add support for multiple languages to make the system accessible globally.

Mobile App Integration:

Develop a mobile app for easier access and usage.

Blockchain for Rewards:

Use blockchain technology to securely manage and track user rewards.

Community Features:

Add a leaderboard and social sharing features to encourage community participation.

Real-Time Camera Integration:

Allow users to classify waste in real-time using their device's camera.

Integration with Local Waste Management Services:

Partner with local waste management services to provide pickup and disposal options.
